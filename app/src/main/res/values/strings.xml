    <string name="tutorialTitle">Overview</string>
    <string name="tutorialDescription">This app presents options for doing long-running tasks in the
        background. Each of the \"Start\" buttons in the cards below will kick off a background task
        that will last ten seconds. If the task completes and successfully communicates the result
        with the activity, a check mark will be displayed.
        \n\nA few ways to test these approaches:
        \n\n<annotation list="bullet">Wait for the task to complete without doing anything.
        </annotation>
        \n<annotation list="bullet">Background the app, wait for the task to complete, then return
            to the app.</annotation>
        \n<annotation list="bullet">Background and foreground the app, then wait for the task to
            complete.</annotation>

    <string name="simpleCallbackTitle">Simple callback</string>
    <string name="simpleCallbackDescription">This approach will run the callback regardless of
        whether the activity is running.
        \n\n<annotation list="bullet">This won\'t work if the activity is ever destroyed &#8211; the
            task won\'t be able to update state for a destroyed activity and won\'t have a reference
            to any new activity.</annotation>

    <string name="saveToDiskTitle">Save to disk</string>
    <string name="saveToDiskDescription">This approach will run the callback if the activity is
        running, but if it\'s not running it will save the result to disk so the activity can read
        it in onStart().
        \n\n<annotation list="bullet">This will work if the activity is destroyed</annotation>
        \n<annotation list="bullet">This won\'t work if the activity is re-created before the task

    <string name="serviceTitle">Bound service</string>
    <string name="serviceDescription">This approach will start a service that will run the task and
        store the result when complete. The activity will attempt to re-bind to this service when
        started, and if the service can be bound then the data will be read from it.
        \n\n<annotation list="bullet">This will work if the activity is destroyed</annotation>
